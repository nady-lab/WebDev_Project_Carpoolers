<h1>Meet John O'Reilly</h1>
<p>
    Hey there! I’m John O’Reilly, the proud owner of <strong>Wheels on Fire</strong>. Cars aren’t just my business — they’re my lifelong passion. I’ve been around engines and grease for as long as I can remember, and I’ll admit it: I’m a bit of a perfectionist. Maybe even more with cars than with people, but that’s between us.<br><br>
    Over the years, I’ve built a collection that I’m genuinely proud of — from classic beauties to modern marvels. Each car has its own story, and I love helping people find the one that matches their personality (and their sense of style). Whether you’re looking for your first car, a weekend cruiser, or something that turns heads at every corner, I’m here to make the process enjoyable — and maybe sneak in a bit of dry humour along the way.<br><br>
    This website is more than just a showcase. It’s a place where fellow car lovers can explore, dream, and maybe even find their next obsession. I believe in treating every car with care, every customer with respect, and every visit with a smile (even if it’s a wry one). So, take a look around, enjoy the collection, and if you see something that makes your heart race, you know where to find me.
