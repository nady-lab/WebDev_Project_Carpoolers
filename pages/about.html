            <h2>Who We Are</h2>
            <p>
                Hi, I'm <strong>John O'Reilly</strong>, the proud owner of <strong>Wheels On Fire</strong>.
                Cars have been my passion for as long as I can remember. Some kids collected trading cards or comics
                but I collected memories of engines roaring, chrome shining, and the smell of petrol hanging in the air.
                Over time, what started as a fascination became a career, and what became a career eventually turned 
                into a business I'm genuinely passionate about.

            <h2>The Beginning</h2>
            <p>
                My love for cars began when I was barely tall enough to see over the dashboard of my dad’s old motor. 
                I’d sit there for hours, pretending to steer, dreaming of the day I’d have a car of my own. 
                Fast forward a few decades, and here I am, still pretending to steer, except now I’ve got an

            <h2>What We Do</h2>
            <p>
                At <strong>Wheels on Fire</strong>, it's not just about buying and selling cars, it's about celebrating them.
                I've spent years curating vehicles that range from <strong>classic gems</strong> with stories etched into 
                every dent and scratch, to <strong>modern machines</strong> that deliver performance and style in equal meansure.
                Every car is chosen with caare, and every detail is inspected, because let's face it, I'm a perfectionist. 
                (I’m probably harsher on spark plugs than I am on people.)
            <br><br>
                When you visit this site, I want you to feel like you’re stepping into my garage. Explore the collection, 
                take a closer look at the details, and imagine yourself behind the wheel. If a car speaks to you, 
                I’ll do my best to make sure it finds its way into your story.

            <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
            <p>
                I believe cars are more than just machines; they're companions, adventrues, and sometimes even works of art.
                Every person who walks through my doors (or clicks through my site) deserves to find a car that makes them smile
                the moment they turn the key.

            <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
            <p>
                This site is just the beginning. My goal is to creat a space where car 
                enthusiasts can not only find their dream ride but also share in the culture, the humour,
                and the stories that make this community so special and unique. Expect more than just listings;
                think blogs, stories, tips, and maybe the occasional grumpy rant about bad parking jobs.

        <section>
            <h2>Join the Journey</h2>
            <p>
                Take your time looking around. If you find a car you love, reach out. If not stick around anyway,
                I promise there'll be somethign here to make you smile. And remember, at <strong>Wheels on Fire</strong>,
                we don't just sell cars. We share stories, build connections, and keep the engines of passion running strong.
